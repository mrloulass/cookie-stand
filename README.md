### Reflections and Comments

* This lab was hard and trying to put the different concepts together became difficult. I've learn to code line by line and use console.log to run code block. I do this to see if the code works.

* I had help from another classmate Tom and TA Bryant.

## cookies-stand part 2

* I replace all of the object literals for the salmon cookie stand with a single constructor function that, when called with the **new** keyword, it creates a new instance.

* I removed the unorder list elements from the HTML file and add a table element. I had the rows, columns and data cells dynamically with JavaScript.

### Reflections and Comments

* You can take an object constructor function an create many objects of the same type. This help with cleaner code, less code lines and more memory space for other data.  I've learn how make a dynamic HTML table for a web site by using JavaScript. I'm still working on understanding the different concepts and how they work together.
