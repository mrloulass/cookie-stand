    <p id="family">
      Pat is from the Pacific Northwest and enjoys baking with their family. They all work together to bring the best cookies in the NorthWest. Pat salmon cookies were first made for their children and the kids loved them so much, they brought them to school and sold them at a bake sale. A local restaurant owner Sam had a child that went to school with Pat’s children. Sam loved cookies and wanted to open a store in Pike place market with these cookies. The store did well so they opened other locations around the world.
